# Stock Predictor
This project uses machine learning to predict the future stock price of ethereum.

## Modules
This repo uses the following modules: 

    yfinance - download the data
    pandas - format the data
    prophet - predict future data (the machine learning module)
    matplotlib - visualize the data

    
## Setup
This repo has a .ipynb file and a .py. Both of these files are the same program. The .ipynb file is for users that like to use the notebook. Both of these files should work fine however, I could not get the .py file to plot the data.
